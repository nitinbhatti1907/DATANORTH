# DATANORTH — v2

A public data platform for Northern Ontario.

Built with NORDIK Institute.

---

## What this release contains

**Tech stack**

- Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS 3 + custom design system (tokens, typography, motion)
- Apache ECharts for charts, TanStack Table for tables, TanStack Query for data
- Framer Motion, lucide-react, Fraunces + Inter + JetBrains fonts

**What works today**

- A premium, institutional homepage with hero, category grid, KPI snapshot, and partners strip
- 10 categories, each with its own landing page, accent color, and imagery
- 13 indicators with full metadata (source, methodology, license, update cadence)
- Per-indicator detail pages with:
  - Interactive ECharts line/bar/table toggle
  - URL-synced geography and year filters
  - **Chart-level CSV and Excel download, respecting active filters** (with a methodology sheet in the Excel export and a provenance README block in the CSV)
- Community profile pages (Sault Ste. Marie is the primary geography, plus Sudbury, Thunder Bay, North Bay, Timmins, Kenora)
- A real 517-row Statistics Canada NOC wage dataset, live at `/jobs`, with sort / filter / download built in
- A real Sault Ste. Marie health services dataset (87 entries) exposed via `/api/health-services`
- Explore page with search + category filter
- Methodology, About, Partners, Contact, Accessibility, Land Acknowledgement, and a 404 page
- SEO: proper metadata, OpenGraph, sitemap, robots
- Accessibility: skip-link, focus rings, `prefers-reduced-motion`, semantic HTML, table views of every chart

**What's sample data vs. real data**

- Two indicators carry **real data** migrated from the prior prototype:
  - `median-wage-by-occupation` (Statistics Canada NOC)
  - `health-services-by-type` (compiled SSM service directory)
- All other indicators carry **synthetic demonstration values** calibrated to realistic orders of magnitude so the UI can be reviewed end-to-end. Every chart, indicator card, and CSV/Excel export that includes sample data is clearly marked. Replace with ingested real values before citing.

npm install

# 2. Copy the env template (optional for local dev)
cp .env.example .env.local

# 3. Run the dev server
npm run dev

# 4. Open http://localhost:3000

## Chart-data download — how it works

Every `ChartPanel` renders a **Download** button that reflects exactly what the user sees on screen.

- The same `queryChartData()` function feeds both the chart and the download, so the export is guaranteed to match the view
- CSV exports include a multi-line provenance block at the top: indicator, source, methodology, license, active filters, export timestamp, and a clear **sample data** warning if the indicator is synthetic
- Excel exports write the data to a **Data** sheet and write provenance into a separate **Methodology** sheet
- Filenames are slugified: `datanorth_<indicator>_<geography>_<date>.csv`

---

## Ready for the future

**URL-synced filters.** Every indicator page encodes its geography and year range in the URL query string. A link to a specific view is a shareable artefact.

**Forecast-ready data model.** The `IndicatorValue` type already includes `isForecast`, `confidenceLow`, `confidenceHigh`, and `modelId`. The ECharts configuration in `ChartPanel` is structured to render a dashed line and shaded band for any point with `isForecast: true` — this is the visual contract for future ML outputs.

**Swappable data layer.** The UI reads from `lib/data/` and `lib/query.ts`. To move to Postgres later, replace the contents of `lib/query.ts` with real DB calls — nothing else changes.

**Two API routes already live.** `/api/chart-data`, `/api/indicators`, `/api/geographies`, and `/api/health-services` are real routes, not static exports. The same shapes the UI consumes are returned by the API, so a mobile app or partner integration can use them directly.

## What's deliberately **not** in this build

These were scoped to later phases in the audit and are not yet built:

- Postgres + Drizzle ORM (uses in-memory data for now)
- Python FastAPI ML service (the data model is forecast-ready; no forecasts are shipped)
- MapLibre geographic choropleth
- Bilingual EN/FR content (the metadata has `locale: "en_CA"`; `next-intl` is not yet wired)
- The AI chat ("NIA") from the prior prototype
- Scraping of live ED wait time from Sault Area Hospital
- Compare-mode side-by-side small multiples (the individual chart supports multiple geographies, but a dedicated compare page is a later phase)
- Data story / insights pages (MDX-driven)

Each of these has a clean addition path. See the audit document for the phased plan.
